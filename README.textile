h1. CLIC

*Command Line Interface Controller*

CLIC is a tiny framework for bootstrapping a standalone Java application.
It provides an abstraction for the well-known @public static void main(String[] arguments)@,
enabling the use of classical Service objects as entry points for program
execution. As well as taking some of the burden off the handling of the arguments String array,
it motivates a more testable approach to interpreting program arguments and delegating to appropriate
business logic, which is often done in the actual @static void main@ method.
